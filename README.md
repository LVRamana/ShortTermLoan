# ShortTermLoan

Created automation framework using Selenium, C#, NUnit, SpecFlow. I've designed .Net framework using Page Object Design Pattern. Due to time constraints, I haven't deep dived in refactoring some code to make it more robust.There is still more work that can be done as part of refactoring.

1. Can create a config files and then can pass browsers(chrome, firefox, IE etc.., ) ,  browser URL's and timeout's from the app config file
2. Managed to create some wait methods but couldnt able to use them properly as part of the solution due to lack of time.
3. Can write the tests in a more dynamic way if time permits
4. Can create screenshot hooks class to handle screenshots(Creates a failure test screenshot to show where exactly test are failing) when a test fails
